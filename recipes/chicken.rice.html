            <h4><strong>Description:</strong></h4>
            <p>"Chicken breast and rice is pretty close to pure protein and carbs. Makes it really easy to track macros. 2 cups of rice is almost 1400 Cals. 400 g chicken breast is 660.

                Rice and chicken is ridiculously easy to eat. Especially after working out" - Mark Whalberg, 2002</p>
